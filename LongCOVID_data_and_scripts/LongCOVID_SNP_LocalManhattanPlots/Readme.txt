The first file, “THREEGWASs4HGICOVID19.gz,” is a compressed csv file containing results of combined genome-wide association study of three COVID-19 GWASs from the Host Genetics Initiatives (HGI) of COVID-191, including HGI-B1, HGI-B2, and HGI-C2, as well as the differential effect size GWAS between HGI-B1 and HGI-B2 (called HGI-B1-vs-B2) that were calculated using differential z-score method according to previous publication2. All the first three HGI GWASs were downloaded from release 7 of HGI (https://www.covid19hg.org/results/r7/). HGI-B1 GWAS was conducted between hospitalized and non-hospitalized COVID-19 among multiple ancestries. HGI-B2 GWAS was generated by comparing hospitalized COVID-19 with general population controls with multiple ancestries. HGI-C2 GWAS was performed by comparing SARS-CoV2 infected individuals with general population controls with multiple ancestries.

Note: the above dataset was generated by running the SAS script “Differential_GWAS_between_HGI_B1_and_HGI_B2_ODA.sas.” Post-GWAS analysis with these 4 COVID-19 GWASs can be performed using the SAS script “PostGWAS4HGI_COVID19.sas.” These scripts can be executed via SAS studio of SAS OnDemond for Academics, which is freely available at https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/on-demand-for-academics.html.

The second file, “CombineLongCOVIDGWAS.gz,” is a compressed, tab-delimited text file containing results of combined genome-wide association study of four long COVID GWASs published by et al.3, with slightly different definition for long COVID cases and controls as follows:
LongCOVID-W1: Strict cases of long COVID after test-verified SARS-CoV-2 infection (n = 3,018) vs. general population controls (n = 994,582), with its download link provided as (https://my.locuszoom.org/gwas/192226/?token=09a18cf9138243db9cdf79ff6930fdf8).
LongCOVID-N2: Broad long COVID cases identified as infected by any SARS-CoV-2 virus (n = 6,450) vs. general population controls (n = 1,093,995), with its download link accessible at (https://my.locuszoom.org/gwas/826733/?token=c7274597af504bf3811de6d742921bc8).
LongCOVID-W2: Strict long COVID cases defined (n = 2,975) vs. strict controls restricted to individuals who were infected by SARS-CoV-2 but were not diagnosed, with long COVID (n = 37,935), which is downloadable at (https://my.locuszoom.org/gwas/793752/?token=0dc986619af14b6e8a564c580d3220b4).
LongCOVID-N1: Broad long COVID cases defined (n = 6,407) vs. strict controls as defined in (n = 46,208), with its download link provided as (https://my.locuszoom.org/gwas/91854/?token=723e672edf13478e817ca44b56c0c068).
The combined long COVID GWAS file is downloadable at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1opd3BSC5JAHoPvDZPmqPB11Ox8YTrG-X/view?usp=sharing.
A SAS script ‘PostGWAS4HGI_Long_COVID.sas’ is provided to evaluate these long COVID GWASs and can be executed via SAS OnDemand for Academics.
